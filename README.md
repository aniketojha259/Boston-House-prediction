House Rent Prediction 🏠💰
A machine learning project to predict house rent prices based on various socio-economic and location-based features. This project explores data preprocessing, visualization, and regression modeling, with a focus on improving prediction accuracy.

📂 Project Overview
This project uses a housing dataset to predict rental prices. The workflow includes:

Cleaning and preprocessing data.
Visualizing key patterns and trends.
Comparing regression models to find the best-performing approach.
Hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy.
📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:

CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town.
ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots.
INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
CHAS: Whether the property bounds the Charles River (1 = yes, 0 = no).
NOX: Nitric oxide concentration.
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940.
DIS: Weighted distances to Boston employment centers.
RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
TAX: Property tax rate.
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio.
B: Proportion of Black population.
LSTAT: % of lower status of the population.
MEDV: Median house value (in $1000's).
